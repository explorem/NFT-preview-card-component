## My process
In this challenge, I practiced using the flexbox property. I used svg files in a different way. I used the img tag for this. It made it easier for me to manage the height and width. I used more flexbox properties such as align-items and justify-content. I thought for a long time how to solve the active state of the picture. Finally, I nested img tags in an additional div and styled it in CSS.
### Built with
